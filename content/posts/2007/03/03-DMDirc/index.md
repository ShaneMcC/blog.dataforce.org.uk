I (Along with [Chris 'MD87' Smith](http://www.md87.co.uk) and [Greg 'Greboid' Holmes](http://www.greboid.com) have recently started working on DMDirc (again, only this time its in Java to help towards the original aim of the project to be a decent, truly cross platform IRC Client)

Its coming along quite well :)

You can track the progress, (and download the current release which is 0.1) at the [Google Code Project](http://code.google.com/p/dmdirc) or the [Project Website](http://www.dmdirc.com/)

Lemme know what you think.

Over the past few weekends I've been (slowly) working on moving my websites around a bit so that things are all in once place, and in the case of this blog, no longer hosted on my home ADSL connection.

At the moment all non-existent pages on http://home.dataforce.org.uk/, http://dataforce.org.uk/ and http://shanemcc.co.uk/ will now redirect to the equivalent link on http://blog.dataforce.org.uk/, over time I will work on moving all public content from these sites over to here (There isn't much, they've mostly been used as dumping grounds!)

After this http://home.dataforce.org.uk/ will be primarily for private things and http://dataforce.org.uk/ and http://shanemcc.co.uk/ will simply redirect here. Eventually I may look to transition this blog over to one of the raw domains (probably dataforce.org.uk). Ultimately I'm trying to do this without breaking any links that may exist to files/etc on these domains.

So if stuff breaks over the next few weeks, that's why. Feel free to leave a comment if you notice anything or something goes missing.

In `$DayJob` we make use of Dell S4048-ON Switches for 10G Top-of-Rack (ToR) switching and also sometimes 10G Aggregation/Core for smaller deployments. They're fairly flexible devices with a high number of 10G ports, some 40Gs and they can do L3 ports and L2 ports. You can also run them either Stacked or in VLT mode for redundancy purposes.

In addition these things use ONIE (Open Network Install Environment) and can run different firmware images - though we almost exclusively run these with DNOS 9 which is the Force10 FTOS code that Dell acquired some time ago rather than DNOS 10.

One evening, I was tasked with an "emergency" build request. We had some kit being shipped to a remote PoP the following day and the intended routers were delayed, so we needed to get something quickly and temporarily in place to take a BGP Transit Feed and deliver VRRP to the rest of the kit. A spare S4048 we had lying around would do the job sufficiently for the time period needed. I figured it wouldn't take too long to get the base config needed and get it ready to be shipped with the rest of the kit.

So I got the Datacenter to rack/cable/console it so that I could begin configuration then set aside some time in the evening to do the work.

As I was watching the switch boot up I noticed something odd. Turns out the last engineer who had used this device had chosen to install the OpenSwitch OPX ONIE firmware on it instead of the usual DNOS9 firmware. So much for my quick and easy config.

At this point, I could have just reloaded the device into the ONIE installer environment and installed DNOS9 and been done with it all. But, I had a fairly open evening, and I'd not yet really played about much with any of the alternative ONIE OSes, so armed with my Yak Sheers, I thought I'd have a look around.

(After all this, I then re-imaged the device onto our standard deployment image of DNOS9 and completed the required config work that I was supposed to be doing.)



I found the [OpenSwitch OPX Configuration Guide](http://archive.openswitch.net/docs/3.0.0/openswitch_opx_300_config_guide.pdf) and started having a read.

TL;DR: It's a Debian box, use `ip` and `/etc/network/interfaces` to configure it.

So I added an IP address to 1 of the interfaces (`e101-001-0` for the first 10G interface on the device) and some default routing and brought up the link, something like:

```bash
ip addr add 192.0.2.2/30 dev e101-001-0
ip route add 0.0.0.0/0 via 192.0.2.1
ip link set dev e101-001-0 up
```

And lo-and-behold, my switch now had internet access..

```bash
admin@OPX:~$ ping 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=119 time=1.31 ms

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.313/1.313/1.313/0.000 ms
admin@OPX:~$
```

Now I could ssh to it and have a look around.

Logging in drops you into a fairly standard debian shell and we can learn a bit about the device:

It's got a fairly weak ATOM CPU, and 4G of RAM, approximately the same as what you'd get in a cheap Â£10/month VPS. Disk space is basically non-existent at less than 5GB.

Nothing to write home about here, but that's ok - this is just the management plane, it doesn't _need_ to be performant. Infact, I'd be disappointed if it was, as it would be a waste in a device like this.

Lets have a look around some more with opx and see what we can see.

There are a whole bunch of `opx-` prefixed commands to interact with the hardware:
```bash
root@OPX:~# opx-show-
opx-show-alms             opx-show-interface        opx-show-log              opx-show-packages         opx-show-stats            opx-show-transceivers     opx-show-vrf
opx-show-env              opx-show-interface-stats  opx-show-mac              opx-show-route            opx-show-system-status    opx-show-version
opx-show-global-switch    opx-show-lag              opx-show-mirror           opx-show-sflow            opx-show-transceiver      opx-show-vlan
root@OPX:~# opx-config-
opx-config-beacon         opx-config-global-switch  opx-config-interface      opx-config-log            opx-config-mirror         opx-config-sflow          opx-config-vlan           opx-config-vxlan.py
opx-config-fanout         opx-config-hybrid-group   opx-config-lag            opx-config-mac            opx-config-route          opx-config-switch         opx-config-vrf
root@OPX:~#
```

The output of these seems reasonably friendly and usable:

Ok, so we've got basic connectivity, but what about if we wanted to do more, like BGP?

The configuration guide says:

> Use the `apt-get install` command to install the latest Debian 9 (stretch) release of the FRR package.

apt you say...

The guide suggested installing the .deb by hand, but I figured it would probably work properly via apt:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install apt-transport-https
curl -s https://deb.frrouting.org/frr/keys.asc | sudo apt-key add -
export FRRVER="frr-stable"
echo deb https://deb.frrouting.org/frr stretch $FRRVER | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/frr.list
apt-get update
apt-get install frr
```

And it actually installed.

At this point, a normal network-person would have then probably continued to look at `frr` and getting it working (I'm sure it works reasonably well, I didn't look).

I'm not a normal network-person. I also like to play about with servers as well.

So armed with the knowledge that `apt` worked... I decided to try installing `docker`... because of course that's the next thing you try to install on a network switch.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian stretch stable" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
apt-get update
apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

And it worked. Docker was installed. And seemingly working.

```bash
root@OPX:~# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
root@OPX:~#
```

So the next obvious thing, what can I run to test this?

How about... this blog?

```bash
root@OPX:~# docker run shanemcc/blog.dataforce.org.uk

```

Well, it seemed to be running:

```bash
root@OPX:~# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                            COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

root@OPX:~#
```

But didn't seem to actually work. Maybe it was too good to be true?

Oh wait - the networking on this is probably a bit weird, maybe the docker bridge/NAT stuff doesn't work... What if we try host-based networking?

```bash
root@OPX:~# docker run --rm --network host --name shaneblogtest shanemcc/blog.dataforce.org.uk

That worked, and then I was able to see this blog in all it's wonder, served from a switch!

{{< postimage src="s4048blog-blur.png" side="none" alt="Blog running on a switch" >}}

(Some of you will note that I didn't actually expose a port properly in the first command, so it may well have worked if I'd done it correctly, I didn't try any further)

I was greatly amused at the idea of this, mainly because it's so stupid (running the blog on a Â£3k Switch that's no more powerful than a Â£10/month VPS).

But also thinking about it more, this is quite exciting.

ONIE/OPX can run on x86 hardware or in a VM with KVM/QEMU/VAGRANT etc so you can actually have local test environments that function similarly to your live production switches, and with docker you can run applications on these devices to handle configuration/automation etc and get all the advantages of a modern development pipeline with reproduceable builds and an easy installation process (`docker run ...`).

Or you could run a blog. Â¯\\\_(ã)\_/Â¯

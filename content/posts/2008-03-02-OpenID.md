Recently I finally finished adding support for [AuthGate](http://www.authgate.co.uk) to be an [OpenID](http://openid.net) Provider.

This prompted [Chris](http://chris.smith.name) to develop [Poidsy](http://apps.md87.co.uk/openid/), which I have also implemented into AuthGate. This allows people to login to AuthGate (and thus also here, and other AuthGate powered sites) using OpenID instead of having to register with AuthGate itself.

As Noted by [Chris](http://chris.smith.name/) recently on IRC, [Google Mail](http://gmail.com) lacks a feature in its ability to automatically label/filter messages - you can't do it based on emails from people in a contact group, short of adding a filter with all their email address on it.

At the time it was mentioned this didn't affect me, however later when I got round to adding loads of labels/filters in gmail (yay for, nicely coloured inbox!) to nicely separate things for me I also ran into this problem, so came up with the following python script that does it for me.

It checks messages, sees if the sender is in the contacts, then checks each group to see if there is a label with that group name that is not already set, then checks to see if the contact is in the group, and finally sets the label if everything matches up.

I ran it initially to tag my entire inbox (set `checkAllIndex` to `True` change `ga.getMessagesByFolder(folderName)` to `ga.getMessagesByFolder(folderName, True)`) and now have it running on a 15 minute cron (not using loopMode) to tag new messages for me.

Hopefully this will be useful to someone else, I'm not sure how well it works in general, it worked fine for me with ~700 messages at first, however after a few runs (due to regrouping some contacts) I was greeted by an `Account Lockdown: Unusual Activity Detected` message when trying to do anything - This went away after about 20 minutes, but don't say you wern't warned if it happens to you.

"""
 This script will login to gmail, and add labels to messages for contact groups.

 By default the script will only check items from the past 2 days where email
 was recieved.

 Loop mode can be enabled to save logging in repeatedly from cron.
 Loop mode may fail after some time if google kills the session, or gmail
 becomes unavailable or so. (Untested in these situations). On the other hand
 it may also just keep running indefinetly as if no problem occured, loop mode
 is relatively untested and was added as an after thought.

 When running in loop mode, it is best to have a crontab entry also that checks
 and restarts the script if it dies.

On a related note, I've also recently started to use the "[Better Gmail 2](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6076)" addon for firefox (Official page seems down atm, but more info [here](http://lifehacker.com/software/exclusive-lifehacker-download/better-gmail-2-firefox-extension-for-new-gmail-320618.php)) mostly for the grouping of labels feature.

**Edit:** Script will now preserve unread status of threads.
